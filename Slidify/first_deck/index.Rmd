## Defintion

Paraphrased from www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cagr.asp:

The month-over-month growth rate of an investment over a specified period of time. The compound monthly growth rate is calculated by taking the nth root of the total percentage growth rate, where n is the number of months in the period being considered.

## Formula

- **CMGR** = Compund Monthly Growth Rate
- **L** = Last Month's value
- **F** = First Month's value
- **N** = Total Number of Month's

CMGR = ((L / F) ^ (1 / N)) - 1

## Function
```{r}
CMGR <- function(last, first, n) {
  paste(round((((last / first) ^ (1 / n)) - 1) * 100, digits = 2), "%")
  }

CMGR(200,100,4)
```
